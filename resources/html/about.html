                <p class="content">I have always been intrigued by space and the vastness of it. I had always
                    enjoyed reading about the moon landings and shuttle launches. As a Christian
                    it boggled my mind that anyone could think it came about randomly. I 
                    saw space as something which attested to God's power!
                    As a five year old,  watching the planetarium show at the Creation 
                    Museum in Kentucky, I was enamored with space. 
                    As soon as I was old enough I became part of my local 4-H Aerospace
                    club. Over many years I have made many model rockets. My goal would
                    be to make high placing models. This would soon change as I became
                    a teen. I got into the logistics of it. The methods and science
                    behind the rockets. When I was 14 I met a friend who introduced
                    me to SpaceX and high tech model rocketry. Particularly the guys
                    at BPS.space. They all ignited my passion and dream of being a 
                    rocket scientist.  Ultimately my dream is to go to college and
                    Major in Aerospace Engineering and work at a respected aerospace 
                    organization. While continuing my rocket research.
                    Starting with AOR, I decided to learn rocketry concepts in High School.
                    The first and current project is Thrust Vectoring.  You can help me 
                    achieve my dream! Check out Patreon and support the fun!</p>
